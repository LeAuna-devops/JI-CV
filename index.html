    <p>Jonathan Imafidor was born in Uneme – Nekhua, a rural part of Southern Nigeria in 1988. He grew up in a small town amidst a vast expanse of tropical vegetation and quiet flowing streams. His love for nature and how people interacted with it grew tremendously and so he spent his early years investigating and creating art from natural materials. Jonathan earned a Bachelor of Arts in Painting from Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife (with honors). He is a recipient of several awards from different International Art competitions and was a lecturer in his alma-mata.<br>
  
    </br/> Within the last decade, Jonathan has been traversing the tropical rural regions of Southern Nigeria and the great plains of Dakota presenting his art to locals and natives through an exhibition of paintings, art workshops, and mural paintings. In his work, culture and history become visually tangible concepts that represent his ideas and experiences which he has lived, learned or gleaned from his cultural background and in his many travels between Africa and America. Most of Jonathan’s public murals could be found in Atlanta GA, Lemmon SD, Faulkton SD, Morristown SD, Hettinger ND, Mellette SD, and most recently, Lake Andes SD.
